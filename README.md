# ElManassa
Developed 'ElManassa' educational application facilitating seamless communication between students, teachers, and parents. The platform empowers teachers to showcase courses through an intuitive and visually appealing GUI, enhancing the user experience. Students can easily explore and subscribe to courses tailored for their respective grades, accessing course details and teacher-created YouTube videos for enhanced learning. The app offers a user-friendly search feature, allowing students to discover courses by simply selecting their grade. Subscribed courses are neatly organized in a dedicated tab, providing convenient access to videos and quizzes assigned by teachers. Students are assigned a unique QR code for their profile, streamlining communication. For parents, 'ElManassa' provides a comprehensive overview of their child's academic journey. Parents can register, scan their child's QR code, and review grades and progress. The app fosters a collaborative educational environment, promoting effective communication between students, teachers, and parents for a holistic learning experience.
